Overview
============
This code will generate a story based on an image that you input. More information can be found in the [original repo](https://github.com/ryankiros/neural-storyteller). This the code for 'Build an AI Writer' on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/x24VEUEph0Q)

*We were barely able to catch the breeze at the beach , and it felt as if someone stepped out of my mind . She was in love with him for the first time in months , so she had no intention of escaping . The sun had risen from the ocean , making her feel more alive than normal . She 's beautiful , but the truth is that I do n't know what to do . The sun was just starting to fade away , leaving people scattered around the Atlantic Ocean . I d seen the men in his life , who guided me at the beach once more.*

I let the woman in her eyes , and I had no idea what to say to her . It was a small group of people , both of them . As soon as the taxi arrived , he gave me a hug . It was the first time I 'd spent so much time in New York . In fact , it was almost as if he were going to be the only man in his life , and he made a mental note to pin her down on either side of her body . She loved those men , a little less than ten minutes and I am stunned by someone . - See more at: http://www.somatic.io/examples/4wDNbDm0#sthash.TvSDmyRU.dpuf
